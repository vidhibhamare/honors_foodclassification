# EffiSwin - An EfficientNet-Swin Transformer Hybrid with Cross-Attention for Food Classification


In smart food services, health tracking, and nutritional monitoring, food image classification is essential. However, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) are powerful, they are computationally demanding and inefficient for real-world applications, whereas typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have trouble grasping global context. In this research, we present EffiSwin, a unique hybrid architecture that leverages a multi-head cross-attention fusion mechanism to combine the global context modelling of Swin Transformer with the local feature extraction capabilities of EfficientNet-B0. To further improve performance, we present label-aware MixUp, which uses a lot less parameters to attain competitive accuracy while managing long-tail class distributions better. Using attention-based heatmaps, our model provides faster inference and better interpretability while achieving 87% accuracy on the Food-101 dataset, exceeding conventional ResNet-ViT hybrids. EffiSwin provides a workable solution for reliable food recognition in a variety of intricate classification tasks by striking a novel balance
